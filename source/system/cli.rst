Command Line Interface
======================

For Command Line Interface(CLI) access to the Genian NAC Appliance, an SSH Client must be used.

If this does not allow you to connect, then you will need to login into the UI and allow your
IP Address or Subnet to connect. See: "Allow Remote Access via SSH" under :doc:`/system/default-settings-appliance`.
