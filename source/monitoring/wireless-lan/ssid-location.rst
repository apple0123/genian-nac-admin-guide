Finding SSID Physical Location
==============================

In a BYOD environment, unknown devices appear at any given time, and when they do, it is the Network Administrators job to track them down. To figure out what devices are
in or outside of a network, various different steps are needed to locate that deviceâ€™s physical location.

Discover what SSID a Device belongs to
--------------------------------------

If a rogue device shows up on the network, the first step to tracking it down is to find which SSID it is connected
to.

#. Go to **Management > Node** in the top panel
#. Click the **IP Address** of the desired node
#. In the **General** tab, under **SSID Connected**, click the **SSID** displayed

All information relevant to that SSID is now displayed in the main panel.

View the Signal Strength of a Device
------------------------------------

A devices relative location can be determined by monitoring the signal strength to figure out which direction
and how close it is. The stronger the signal, the closer the device.

The signal strength is depicted in two ways:

- **Color/Icon**: Red means weak, Orange means not an ideal signal, and Green means a strong signal connection
- **dBm**: This is the decibel strength of the signal. The lower the numbers, the closer the stronger the signal and closer the device

The device can now be tracked down to a relative location. The device can then 
be looked for or employees can be inquired about the device until it is found.
