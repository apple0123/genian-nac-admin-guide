Allow SSH Access
================

Genian NAC by default does not allow for SSH access to the appliance until the Administrator allows for this access by adding a 
single IP Address or a Network Address. You can add a single IP Address if you are the only Administrator, or add Network address 
if you many Administrators. (*e.g. 192.168.10.10, 192.168.10.0/24, or any IP using 0.0.0.0/0*)
